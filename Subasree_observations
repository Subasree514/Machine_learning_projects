For the heart data provided, both the algorithms logistic regression and random forest performed almost similar.
 I do not think there is a significant difference in the accuracy of the predictions from  both of them. 
 Among the top three features with higher weights, two of them coincided in the predictions from the two algorithms. 
 They are thalach : Maximum heart rate during the stress test (#1 for logistic and #2 for RF) and oldpeak : Decrease of the ST segment during exercise according to the same one on rest at #3 in both of them. 
 The feature at rank 2 for logistic is reversible -> thal: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)and at rank 1 for RF is ca : Number of main blood vessels coloured by the radioactive dye (the number varies between 0 to 3). 
 Removal of the bottom two or three features which contributed the least to the features did not improve the accuracy of the predictions in bith, it worsened them.
